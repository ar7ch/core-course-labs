# Project meta-description

## Framework rationale
Go is widely used for backend development, so I've decided to practice in this language.
To develop an app, I used standard Go libraries for HTTP and networking, since their functionality is mature and self-sufficient to write web applications, especially simple ones.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
I've decided to take a test-driven approach so I've written tests before implementing certain functionality in the application.
Tests are carried out using Go's builtin `go test` (`make test`) functionality.

## Following coding standards
I have used builtin `go vet` (`make lint`) to check my code for problems.
